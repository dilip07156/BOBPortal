                    agree(s) and acknowledges that the BOBCARDS shall in no way be held responsible
                    or liable, if the CARDHOLDER/ User(s) incurs any loss as a result of the Password
                    being disclosed/ shared by the CARDHOLDERs and/ or, as the case may be, the User(s)

                <p>
                    iii. The CARDHOLDER and the Users authorized by the CARDHOLDER shall keep the Password
                    including the password used to encrypt the private key absolutely confidential and
                    well protected and shall not reveal the same to any unauthorized third person, including
                    the employees and representatives of Bobcards. Bobcards does not take or accept

                    and the CARDHOLDER shall be bound by the private key and the public key so downloaded/

                    takes full responsibility for the safe custody of the private key so generated and
                    the CARDHOLDER would be responsible for and bound by any and all instructions given
                    and/ or transactions carried out by the members of its organization by using the
                    private key and the public key downloaded/generated by them. Any Instruction(s)
                    received by Bobcards from the server / machine of the CARDHOLDER where the private

                    own risks and consequences and Bobcards shall be entitled to presume as genuine
                    all Instructions given by using the Security Procedure.</p>
                <p>

                    purpose of issuing digital signatures and the CARDHOLDER shall not raise any objections
                    as a consequence of Bobcards acting in one or more capacities, apart from being
                    the relying party, who relies on the use of the digital signature availed of by

                        to do so, for example to protect the CARDHOLDER when there is a suspected breach
                        of security or other reasons under which the BOBCARDS may in its sole discretion
                        deem fit/ necessary for suspending such Services.</li>
                    <li>The BOBCARDS will use reasonable efforts to inform the CARDHOLDER without undue
                        delay through the Portal/ Website Service, and/or the Website if the Services or

                        Law.</li>
                    <li>A transaction being carried out is not always simultaneous with an Instruction being

                        type of transaction and time restrictions including working hours, although the

                        Account maintained with the BOBCARDS to other accounts, whether belonging to the

                        such transfers.</li>
                    <li>In case any Instruction is not effected for any reason, the BOBCARDS shall use its
                        reasonable endeavours to intimate the status of the same to the CARDHOLDER through
                        the Website, or in such other manner as the BOBCARDS may, in its absolute discretion,
